            <p>If you want to work out five days per week and are working on both strength and cardiovascular fitness, try three days of strength training, two days of cardio, and two days of rest. If you want to work out four days a week, think about your goals: If you want to add muscle, cut a cardio day.
        Take the first 10 minutes to get your body moving. Cardio machines are a great place to start. Try taking a walk, or light jog, on the treadmill, or give the bike a spin. Whatever you choose, you should be working hard enough to get your heart rate up and break out in a slight sweat before moving on.
        If you are exercising for more than an hour you should eat beforehand to get the most from your training, but not too soon beforehand. What you eat is only useful once it has been digested. So ideally, have a balanced meal two to three hours before working out – a bit longer before is fine too.</p>

<div class="text1">
<p>Going to the gym for the first time doesn’t need to be daunting. Adam Hameed, personal trainer at Nuffield Health, offers some beginner workouts to help you feel confident and get the most out of your gym time.
    Everyone has different reasons for joining a gym but for anyone just starting out on their journey, understanding how to use equipment effectively can be confusing. These beginner gym workouts are ideal for various goals, whether you want to lose weight or burn fat, build muscle and strength, or improve your fitness.
    
    Your gym membership will include an induction with an expert personal trainer, so make the most of this time with them. The gym staff are really helpful and friendly so they can show you how to do the exercises and answer any questions.
    As a beginner, how long should I do the workout for?
    Start by setting a goal to continue with the workout programme for three months. Creating a long-term exercise routine is all about forming positive habits, which means giving your mind and body the time to adjust to doing something new.
    
    Each workout should take 45 minutes to an hour and you should always leave 48 hours between workouts to rest and recover properly. A Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine works well for most people.</p>
   
  <h1>As a beginner, how much weight should I lift?
</h1>
<p>The best thing you can do is start at the lower end of the weight spectrum and work your way up until you reach about 60 to 70% of your max limit (the most amount of weight you can lift for one repetition with good form). That will give you a rough idea of what to start on, allowing you to slowly increase the weight little by little every week.

</p>

<h1>What are reps and sets?
</h1>
<ol>Reps: a rep is how many times you repeat a specific exercise
    </ol>
    <ol>
        Sets: a set is how many rounds of reps you do</ol>
<p>So if you lift 10 times on a bench press, that would be ‘one set of 10 reps’. If you took a short break and then did the same again, you’ll have completed ‘two sets of 10 reps’.

    How many reps and sets you go for depends on what you’re trying to achieve. More reps at a lower weight would improve your endurance, while fewer reps at a higher weight would build your muscle mass.
    
    When it comes to sets, people usually aim for between three to five, depending on how many you can complete without compromising your form.</p>

 <h1>Tips for each workout
</h1>
<li>Go slow – focus on your technique
</li>
<li>Rest for 60-90 seconds between each set
</li>
<li>Keep moving when you're resting – a gentle walk around the gym floor will keep your muscles warm and your heart rate up
</li>
<li>Ideally perform the workout in the order listed, but if equipment is busy then switch the order for convenience.
</li>

<h1>Beginner gym workout for females
</h1>
<p>This workout for females is designed to tone the whole body, with a slight emphasis on the legs and glutes (bottom). It’s a myth that women will become bulky if they lift weights. Weight training in fact helps women become stronger, leaner and more toned. Read this guide to help you get started.
